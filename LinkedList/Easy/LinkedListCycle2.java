/*
 * Problem - Linked List Cycle II (Leetcode #142)
 * Difficulty - Medium
 * Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
 *
 * Topics: Linked List, Two Pointers
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm to detect the cycle.
 * - Once slow == fast, reset slow to head.
 * - Move slow and fast one step at a time; where they meet again is the start of the cycle.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
